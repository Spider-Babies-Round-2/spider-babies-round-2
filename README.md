**🐍 Create Python virtual environment**

There are a good amount of depencies for this project -- it will be good practice to use a virtual environment, albeit not necessary.

On macOS and Linux:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

On Windows:

```
python -m venv env
```

Alternative for windows: 

```
py -m venv env
```

The second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. Generally, you can just create this in your project and call it env.


**✅ Activate virtual environment**

On macOS and Linux:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

On Windows Command Line:

```
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

One Windows Powershell

```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

**📦 Navigate to the repository folder and install packages**

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
